# üèÜ Name Leaderboard App

This is a simple web application that allows users to submit their names, which will be displayed on the site along with a live countdown showing how long the name has been displayed. The name can be replaced by another user, and a leaderboard tracks the top 5 names with the longest display times.

## üöÄ Features

- **Live Countdown**: Shows how long the current name has been displayed.
- **Real-Time Updates**: The leaderboard updates in real-time, reflecting changes across all users.
- **Leaderboard**: Tracks the top 5 names with the longest display times.
- **Profanity Filter**: Ensures that submitted names are appropriate.
- **Animations**: Smooth fade-in and fade-out animations on leaderboard updates.
- **No Empty Names**: Prevents empty name submissions and caps name length at 10 characters.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **React**: Frontend library used to build the user interface.
- **Firebase**: Backend services for database, real-time updates, and hosting.
- **Netlify**: Platform for hosting the application.

## üì¶ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Firebase Account**: Set up a Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/name-leaderboard-app.git
   cd name-leaderboard-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up Firebase**:
   - Create a Firebase project from the Firebase Console.
   - In your project settings, add a new web app to obtain the Firebase configuration.
   - Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory of your project and add your Firebase configuration:

     ```bash
     REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
     REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project_id.firebaseapp.com
     REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
     REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project_id.appspot.com
     REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
     REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
     ```

4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Deploying to Netlify

1. **Build the app**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy on Netlify**:
   - Create an account on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
   - In Netlify, create a new site from Git (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
   - Select your repository.
   - For the build settings:
     - **Build Command:** `npm run build`
     - **Publish Directory:** `build`

3. **Set up Environment Variables on Netlify**:
   - Go to your site settings on Netlify.
   - Navigate to "Environment variables" and add the Firebase configuration as key-value pairs.

4. **Deploy**:
   - Netlify will automatically deploy your site, and it will be live at a unique Netlify subdomain.
   - Optionally, you can configure a custom domain.

### Optional: Custom Redirects

If using React Router or custom routing, create a `_redirects` file in the `public` folder:

```
/* /index.html 200
```

This ensures proper handling of routes by redirecting all requests to `index.html`.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

- **Timer Starts in Negative**: Ensure the timer is set using the correct timestamp from Firebase.
- **Netlify Deployment Issues**: Verify the build and publish settings, and ensure environment variables are correctly set up.
- **Firebase Errors**: Double-check your Firebase configuration and rules.
